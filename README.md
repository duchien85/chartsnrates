*Cryptocurrency charts and rates app based on Binance exchange data*

Chart-n-Rates is a showcase of android application, that uses realtime data to build stock charts and infolists.

It demonstrates the use of [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) to create realtime charts with the help of OpenGL 2D-graphics
Also app demonstrates the use of [material principles](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html#introduction-principles) to create simple and understandable UIs.
